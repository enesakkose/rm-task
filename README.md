# Rast Mobile Task
## Overview

The project is created with React.js and its main objective is to allow users to easily add their social media accounts to a data grid table.

</div>

## What I learned

- I have dealt with more detailed usage examples of the sort method.
- I learned how to make pagination.
- I learned how to use the react context api more efficiently.
- I took care to make all structures by separating them into components. This made the application easier to maintain.
- The grid system in CSS was used to style the table easily, making the styling process more straightforward and efficient.
- The application was made without using any datagrid library, in this way, more benefit from the React library.
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) and [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) packages were used for the construction and validation of the forms.
- TypeScript has been used in this project to enhance type safety and ensure better code integrity.
