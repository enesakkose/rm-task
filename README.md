# Rast Mobile Task
## Overview

The main goal of this project is to create a datagrid where users can enter their social media account information. Project created with [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/).
## What I learned

- I have dealt with more detailed usage examples of the sort method.
- I learned how to make pagination.
- I learned how to use the react context api more efficiently.
- I took care to make all structures by separating them into components. This made the application easier to maintain.
- The application was made without using any datagrid library, in this way, more benefit from the React library.
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) and [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) packages were used for the construction and validation of the forms.
